First things first, you need to install the node modules in each resource that is required down below, make sure you go that resource and open the **ui** folder and then do the following command.

## To Install

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn
```

## To Build

```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

The current resources that need to be installed & builded are:
 
- bs_base
- bs_api
- bs_menu
- bs_bank
- bs_characters
- bs_inventory
- bs_loadscreen
- bs_mdt
- bs_radio
- bs_ui

Once the modules are installed & builded, you need to setup the convars a `.cfg` file.

Read more about convars [**here**](convars.md).

Blue Sky is a FiveM custom framework that works with components made by **Alzar** & **Discworld**. Now in hands of [Scorz](https://github.com/GitScorz) and the rest of the community.

<h2>What are components?</h2>
<p>Components are the building blocks of the framework. They are used to give flexibility to the framework and more easy & quick to use, so you don't have to modify core code.</p>
